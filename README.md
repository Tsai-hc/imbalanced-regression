# imbalanced-regression
In the context of 5G severity diagnosis, it is
 often easy to collect a large amount of normal data. However, collecting data for
 severe faults may be challenging because they occur infrequently. Alternatively,
 you may already have some data in each class, but the data distribution among
 the targets is imbalanced. These factors significantly affect the accuracy of DNN
 models. Moreover, to meet the training standard of supervised learning, adding
 additional data to the existing dataset is time-consuming and costly
